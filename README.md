# Learning Path: Java Backend Development with Spring Boot

This guide outlines the key areas to focus on when learning Java for backend development, emphasizing Core Java concepts and the Spring Boot framework.

## 1. Environment Setup

* **JDK (Java Development Kit):**
    * **Description:** The core platform for developing and running Java applications. Includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and development tools (compiler).
    * **Action:** Install a recent LTS (Long-Term Support) version like Java 17 or 21. Verify installation using `java -version` and `javac -version`.
* **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):**
    * **Description:** A code editor with tools for coding, building, debugging, and testing.
    * **Action:** Choose one like IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition is free and excellent), Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions.
* **Build Tool (Maven or Gradle):**
    * **Description:** Automates the build process, including dependency management (fetching libraries) and packaging the application. Spring Boot heavily relies on these.
    * **Action:** Install either Maven or Gradle. IntelliJ IDEA usually bundles them. Learn the basics of `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle).

## 2. Core Java Fundamentals

    * **Importance:** Provides the foundation for Spring Boot.
* **Inversion of Control (IoC) / Dependency Injection (DI):**
    * **Description:** A design principle where object dependencies are injected from an external source (the Spring Container) rather than created internally. Key annotations: `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`, `@Autowired`.
    * **Importance:** *The* core concept of Spring. Promotes loose coupling and testability.
